## Transit Vancouver: Privacy Policy

Transit Vancouver is an Android app developed by Quinn Hsu. The app is available on the Google Play Store.

After you consent to sharing your location, the app will simply send your location to Translink servers to get the relevent bus scheduling information. Your location data is only gathered and used when the app is open in the foreground. You can stop all collection of location data easily and at any time by disabling location services in your deviceâ€™s settings or by uninstalling Transit Vancouver.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `Location` | This is required to automatically get the relevent bus scheduling information for your current position |
| `Storage` | Required to save your preferences within the app. Example: favourite bus stops, size of icons, etc. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,<br>
